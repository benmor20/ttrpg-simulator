In D&D, the players know the relevant statistics for their own characters, and sometimes for their entire party, while the Dungeon Master, or DM, (the chief storyteller of the game, who provides the scenarios and context for the player characters to engage with) often obscures the relevant statistics of the opposing character(s). Usually, the players are entirely unaware of what statistics, skills, and special abilities an enemy combatant posesses until they are exposed to its moveset, attack, and defense abilities in real-time during a battle. Knowing this, we wondered: with a basic understanding of Bayesian probability, how easy or quick would it be for a player party to be able to correctly guess an enemy combatant's relevant statistics in battle?\n\nIn order to understand what goes into that process, let's first talk a bit more about the way combat in a TTRPG, namely D&D, is run.\n\n# Dungeons and Dragons Combat Mechanics\n\nCombat, in the world of Dungeons and Dragons, is a surprisingly civilized affair: opposing parties operate on a turn-based system, determined initially by which character is quickest to act (through an \"Initiative Roll\"), followed by the next, down the line and looping back around to the same order in the next round of combat. During one's turn, a character can act in a few different ways. They can make an Attack, which may be either Melee, Ranged, Magical, or in some cases, using a Special Ability. They can Move, a number of feet based on their Speed statistic. They can also perform Bonus Actions or act upon any other Special Abilities they have. \n\nAn Attack hits an opponent if the Attack Roll (1 roll of a 20-sided die, known as a d20, plus the attacker's relevant weapon modifier and Proficiency Bonus, if applicable) is greater than or equal to the defender's Armor Class, or AC (the character's Dexterity modifier, plus 10, plus any bonus from worn armor). Damage is determined by a roll of a die, often either a d4, a d6, or a d8, depending on the weapon used, and the damge is subtracted by the character's total amount of Hit Points, or HP. When a character's HP is 0 or less, the character is unconscious and cannot take further action in battle. Combat ends when one full party is decommissioned from battle, meaning all characters are unconscious or dead, or if one party flees or surrenders in some other manner.\n\nIn our model, we have made several simplifications and allowances for ease of following combat proceedings. Since a character's special abilities can become hyper-specialized, further abilities are gained by increasing character level, and the amount of magical combat spells in D&D is exorbitant, we decided to stick to Melee weapons combat, giving each character a weapon that utilizes either their Strength statistic or their Dexterity statistic. Additionally, we decided to ignore speed in an effort for this to not evolve into a project involving game theory, strategy interviews, or any models for random motion. This is D&D combat in its purest, simplest form: a bunch of characters standing around and hitting each other. What could be better?",
